## Part 1: workplan.json

### 1.1 Schema Compliance

- [ ] `metadata`, `project`, `calendar`, `tasks`, `milestones`, `timeline` all present
- [ ] All task IDs are unique (no duplicates)
- [ ] All `dependencies` reference valid task IDs
- [ ] All `start_date` and `deadline` values are `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- [ ] All `start_date_display` and `deadline_display` values are `M/D/YYYY` format
- [ ] `team_members` array has exactly 5 elements (padded with `""` if needed)
- [ ] Every `team_capacity` array in `timeline[]` has exactly 5 elements

### 1.2 Calendar and Feasibility

- [ ] `start_date` = "2025-03-03"
- [ ] `end_date` = "2025-05-09"
- [ ] `available_business_days` is plausible (approx 48 business days; verify weekends excluded)
- [ ] `estimated_total_days` equals the sum of all task `duration_days`
- [ ] `feasibility_flag` is consistent with ratio: estimated ÷ available
- [ ] `feasibility_note` is a clear plain-English sentence
- [ ] OOO/PTO dates (if any) are reflected in `pto_dates` array

### 1.3 Task Structure

- [ ] At least 3 phases identified (Discovery, Analysis/Drafting, Review/Delivery)
- [ ] Tasks decompose deliverables into constituent steps (not just "Write report")
- [ ] Draft report task includes: drafting + client review + revisions (separate tasks)
- [ ] At least 15 tasks total
- [ ] Every task has `start_date` ≤ `deadline`
- [ ] No task `deadline` falls on a weekend
- [ ] No task `start_date` falls on a weekend
- [ ] All tasks finish by `calendar.end_date`
- [ ] Dependencies are correctly modeled (e.g., synthesis after interviews; draft after synthesis)
- [ ] Client review lag of ~5 days included after draft delivery (per SOW)

### 1.4 Milestones

- [ ] At least 4 milestones identified
- [ ] Kickoff present as `type: "internal"`
- [ ] Draft report delivery present as `type: "external"`
- [ ] Final delivery (May 9) present as `type: "external"`
- [ ] Board presentation (~May 16) present as `type: "external"`

### 1.5 Timeline Matrix

- [ ] One entry per calendar week (no gaps from 3/3 through 5/9)
- [ ] `week_start` always falls on a Monday
- [ ] `key_activities` populated for weeks with active tasks
- [ ] `deadlines_milestones` populated for milestone weeks
- [ ] `internal_meetings` and `external_meetings` populated appropriately
- [ ] OOO notes reflected in `pto` and relevant `team_capacity` entries

## Part 2: .xlsx Output

### 2.1 Cover Sheet

- [ ] A1 = project name (not "Untitled Project")
- [ ] B2 = "25-0442" (cost code from SOW)
- [ ] A8:A12 = team member names (or empty strings)
- [ ] A15:A20 = phase names (matching phases in tasks)

### 2.2 Project Timeline Sheet

- [ ] Row 1 (cols B+) = week start dates in M/D/YYYY format
- [ ] A10:A14 = team member names (matching Cover Sheet A8:A12)
- [ ] Phase name written in row 4 for each week
- [ ] Key activities populated in row 5 for active weeks
- [ ] Deadlines/milestones populated in row 6 for milestone weeks
- [ ] Unused week columns (beyond last project week) are hidden
- [ ] At most 25 week columns used (warn if more)

### 2.3 Detailed Workplan Sheet

- [ ] Row 1 header visible with correct column labels
- [ ] All tasks written as rows (count: ___; expected: ≥15)
- [ ] Column A (Phase) populated for every row
- [ ] Column D (Owner) populated where owners were specified
- [ ] Column E (Status) = "Not started" for all rows
- [ ] Column F (Start Date) in M/D/YYYY format
- [ ] Column G (Deadline) in M/D/YYYY format
- [ ] Status dropdown works: click E2, verify "Not started / To-Do / In progress / Completed"
- [ ] Conditional formatting works: type "Completed" in E2, verify row turns gray
- [ ] Conditional formatting applies beyond row 54 (test row 60 if ≥60 tasks, else row 55)
- [ ] No feasibility warning banner (if `feasibility_flag = "ok"`)
- [ ] **If feasibility_flag ≠ "ok"**: orange banner row visible at top of data with note text

## Part 3: Skill Behavior

### 3.1 Information Gathering

- [ ] Skill asked for project start date, end date, team members, cost code, and OOO in a single message before building the schedule
- [ ] Skill did not proceed until both dates were confirmed

### 3.2 Communication

- [ ] Summary message clearly states: project name, timeline, feasibility status, task count
- [ ] If feasibility flag is not "ok": explicitly called out in the summary with `feasibility_note`
- [ ] Structural inferences noted in task `notes` fields or metadata

### 3.3 Robustness

- [ ] No tasks scheduled on weekends
- [ ] No tasks scheduled on OOO dates
- [ ] All tasks fall within project start–end window
- [ ] `estimated_total_days` matches sum of `duration_days` (no arithmetic error)
