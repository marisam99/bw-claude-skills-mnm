PROJECT OVERVIEW

SCOPE OF WORK

Phase 1: Discovery and Research (approximately 4 weeks)

Bellwether will begin with a project kickoff meeting with foundation staff to align on research questions, key stakeholders to engage, and the target audience for the final deliverables. Following kickoff, the team will conduct a desk review of existing literature and data on financial services access, drawing on national datasets, academic research, and practitioner publications. The team will also identify and interview 8–10 practitioners, advocates, and policymakers working in this space. Interviews will be scheduled and conducted in rolling fashion, and results will be synthesized into a structured set of findings.

Phase 2: Analysis and Drafting (approximately 3 weeks)

Building on the Discovery phase, the team will analyze findings and develop the narrative arc of the final report. A full draft of the report will be produced and shared with the foundation for review. The foundation will have 5 business days to provide written feedback. Following receipt of feedback, the team will revise and finalize the report. The team will also develop the executive summary presentation based on the final report.

Phase 3: Review and Delivery (approximately 2 weeks)

The final report and presentation will undergo an internal quality review before delivery. Following internal review, any final revisions will be made. The final deliverables — the report and the presentation — will be delivered to the foundation on the project end date. Bellwether will deliver a brief (30-minute) presentation of findings to the foundation board approximately one week after final delivery, pending board calendar availability.

PROJECT TEAM

The project will be led by a Bellwether Senior Partner, with day-to-day project management handled by an Associate Partner. A Senior Analyst will lead desk research and data analysis. A second Analyst will support interview scheduling, note-taking, and synthesis.
