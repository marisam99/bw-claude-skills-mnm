The team members are: Alice Nguyen (Senior Partner), Bob Reyes (Associate Partner), Carol Kim (Senior Analyst), Dana Park (Analyst). No PTO or OOO dates to block off.\n\n---\n\nSTATEMENT OF WORK\nFinancial Services Initiative — Strategic Landscape Analysis\nSubmitted to: Meridian Family Foundation\nSubmitted by: Bellwether Education Partners\nDate: February 2025\n\nPROJECT OVERVIEW\n\nBellwether will conduct a strategic landscape analysis of financial services and products aimed at low-income households, with a focus on identifying gaps in access, emerging models, and policy levers. The project will produce a final report of approximately 25 pages and an accompanying 20-slide executive summary presentation for a foundation board briefing.\n\nSCOPE OF WORK\n\nPhase 1: Discovery and Research (approximately 4 weeks)\n\nBellwether will begin with a project kickoff meeting with foundation staff to align on research questions, key stakeholders to engage, and the target audience for the final deliverables. Following kickoff, the team will conduct a desk review of existing literature and data on financial services access, drawing on national datasets, academic research, and practitioner publications. The team will also identify and interview 8–10 practitioners, advocates, and policymakers working in this space. Interviews will be scheduled and conducted in rolling fashion, and results will be synthesized into a structured set of findings.\n\nPhase 2: Analysis and Drafting (approximately 3 weeks)\n\nBuilding on the Discovery phase, the team will analyze findings and develop the narrative arc of the final report. A full draft of the report will be produced and shared with the foundation for review. The foundation will have 5 business days to provide written feedback. Following receipt of feedback, the team will revise and finalize the report. The team will also develop the executive summary presentation based on the final report.\n\nPhase 3: Review and Delivery (approximately 2 weeks)\n\nThe final report and presentation will undergo an internal quality review before delivery. Following internal review, any final revisions will be made. The final deliverables — the report and the presentation — will be delivered to the foundation on the project end date. Bellwether will deliver a brief (30-minute) presentation of findings to the foundation board approximately one week after final delivery, pending board calendar availability.\n\nPROJECT TEAM\n\nThe project will be led by a Bellwether Senior Partner, with day-to-day project management handled by an Associate Partner. A Senior Analyst will lead desk research and data analysis. A second Analyst will support interview scheduling, note-taking, and synthesis.\n\nTIMELINE AND DELIVERABLES\n\nProject start: March 3, 2025\nProject end / final delivery: May 9, 2025\n\nDeliverables:\n1.
