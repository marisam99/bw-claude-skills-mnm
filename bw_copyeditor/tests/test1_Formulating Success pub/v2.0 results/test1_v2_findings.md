## Introduction

- Location: Para 1, "leading to a push for greater effort to show"
  Category: Word Choice
  Issue: "effort" should be plural to match the variety of efforts described
  Fix: "effort" → "efforts"
  Type: tracked_change
  Comment: "Word Choice: 'efforts' (plural) better matches the range of accountability activities described."

- Location: Para 1, "synthesizes extant research"
  Category: Word Choice
  Issue: "extant" is unnecessarily formal; "existing" is clearer

  Type: tracked_change
  Comment: "Word Choice: 'existing' is clearer and more accessible than 'extant.'"

- Location: Para 1, "it is a resource for anyone --- policymakers, advocates, funders, or others --- who seeks to understand"
  Category: Clarity
  Issue: Parenthetical with em dashes is heavy; can be simplified
  Fix: "it is a resource for anyone --- policymakers, advocates, funders, or others --- who seeks" → "it serves as a resource for policymakers, advocates, funders, and others seeking"
  Type: tracked_change
  Comment: "Clarity: simplify parenthetical construction."

- Location: Para 1, "equip decision-makers with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions"
  Category: Repetitive Phrasing

  Type: tracked_change

## Reasons States Consider Outcomes-Based Funding

- Location: "Outcomes-based funding models differ..." section, para 1, "institutional initiatives, and personnel costs"
  Category: Word Choice
  Issue: "and" implies exhaustive list; these are examples
  Fix: "and personnel costs" → "or personnel costs"
  Type: tracked_change
  Comment: "Word Choice: 'or' better reflects that these are examples, not an exhaustive list."

- Location: Same section, para 2, "many states have pivoted to use funding formulas (and many with increasing numbers of inputs)"
  Category: Wordiness
  Issue: "and" before parenthetical is unnecessary
  Fix: "(and many" → "(many"
  Type: tracked_change
  Comment: "Wordiness: remove unnecessary 'and' in parenthetical."

- Location: Same section, para 2, "distribute funding in a fairer, more rational way"
  Category: Precision
  Issue: "funding" (the approach/system) vs. "funds" (the money being distributed)
  Fix: "funding" → "funds"
  Type: tracked_change
  Comment: "Precision: 'funds' refers to the money being distributed; 'funding' refers to the approach."

- Location: Same section, para 2, "full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment, and"
  Category: AP Style
  Issue: FTE already defined earlier in the paragraph; second parenthetical is redundant
  Fix: Remove "(FTE)" from the second instance
  Type: tracked_change
  Comment: "AP Style: acronym already defined in this paragraph."

- Location: Same section, para 3, "some level of funding through an outcomes-based model"
  Category: Wordiness
  Issue: "some level of" is vague filler
  Fix: "some level of funding through an outcomes-based model" → "some funding using outcomes-based models"
  Type: tracked_change
  Comment: "Wordiness: 'some level of' adds no precision; also 'models' (plural) since 30+ states have different models."

- Location: Same section, Table caption
  Category: Formatting
  Issue: Table is not numbered; should be "Table 1" for cross-referencing
  Fix: "Table. Examples" → "Table 1. Examples"
  Type: tracked_change
  Comment: "Formatting: number tables for cross-referencing."

- Location: Same section, para after table, "Table" in-text reference

  Type: tracked_change
  Comment: "Wordiness: 'practices' adds nothing; 'accountability' suffices."

- Location: Same section, para 2, "have worked to design elements of funding adequacy into"
  Category: Word Choice
  Issue: "design...into" is clunky
  Fix: "design elements of funding adequacy into" → "incorporate elements of funding adequacy into"
  Type: tracked_change
  Comment: "Word Choice: 'incorporate into' is more natural than 'design into.'"

- Location: "Evidence on the effectiveness..." heading
  Category: Wordiness
  Issue: "however" in a heading adds unnecessary weight
  Fix: Remove ", however,"
  Type: tracked_change
  Comment: "Wordiness: 'however' is unnecessary in a heading; the contrast is clear from context."

- Location: Same section, para 1, "outcomes-based state models"
  Category: Clarity
  Issue: "state" is ambiguous here (could mean "state-level" or "state of being")
  Fix: "outcomes-based state models" → "outcomes-based funding models"
  Type: tracked_change
  Comment: "Clarity: 'funding' is clearer than 'state' as a modifier here."

- Location: Same section, para 2, "There could be several potential explanations"
  Category: Wordiness
  Issue: "could be" + "potential" is redundant; both express possibility
  Fix: "There could be several potential explanations" → "There are several potential explanations"
  Type: tracked_change
  Comment: "Wordiness: 'could be' is redundant with 'potential.'"

- Location: Same section, para 2, "fail to move the needle"

- Location: Same section, para 3, "just one outcome metric --- certificate awards --- found"
  Category: Comma Usage
  Issue: Em dashes used for a simple appositive; commas would suffice
  Fix: "--- certificate awards ---" → ", certificate awards,"
  Type: tracked_change
  Comment: "Comma Usage: commas suffice for a simple appositive; reserve em dashes for more disruptive asides."

- Location: Same section, para 3, "variation in how states defined and used that metric for funding allocations"
  Category: Wordiness
  Issue: Can be tightened
  Fix: "in how states defined and used that metric for funding allocations" → "in how states defined and used it for allocating funds"
  Type: tracked_change
  Comment: "Wordiness: tighten construction; also 'funds' (money) vs. 'funding' (system)."

- Location: Same section, para 4, "these formulas may serve as a strategy to push schools"
  Category: Word Choice
  Issue: "serve as a strategy" is wordy; "push" is informal
  Fix: "may serve as a strategy to push schools to increase" → "may be an effective strategy to encourage institutions to increase"
  Type: tracked_change
  Comment: "Word Choice: 'push schools' is informal for a publication; 'encourage institutions' aligns with the document's register."

- Location: Sidebar, heading "Sidebar: Outcomes-Based Funding as a Policy Tool"
  Category: Structural
  Issue: First sidebar is labeled "Sidebar 1"; this sidebar has no number, creating an inconsistency
  Fix: Flag with comment

  Comment: "Wordiness: 'also' is unnecessary here."

- Location: Sidebar, para 1, "what is the appropriate state role in boosting"

  Fix: "the appropriate state role" → "the appropriate role of the state"
  Type: tracked_change
  Comment: "Clarity: 'role of the state' avoids reading 'state role' as a compound noun."

- Location: Sidebar, para 2, "government operates differently from business contexts"
  Category: Wordiness
  Issue: "contexts" is unnecessary
  Fix: "business contexts" → "business"
  Type: tracked_change
  Comment: "Wordiness: 'business' is sufficient without 'contexts.'"

- Location: Post-sidebar, para 1, "some stakeholders may be rightfully skeptical of outcomes-based funding models, but they are still appealing"
  Category: Clarity
  Issue: Long sentence; "but" pivot could be clearer with a semicolon
  Fix: ", but they are still appealing" → "; however, they are still appealing"
  Type: tracked_change
  Comment: "Clarity: semicolon + 'however' gives the pivot more weight in this long sentence."

- Location: Same section, para 2, "the need for a skilled workforce and filling talent shortages"
  Category: Parallelism
  Issue: "need for X and filling Y" — mismatched forms

  Type: tracked_change
  Comment: "Wordiness: subject already established; 'they' is unnecessary."

- Location: Same section, para 3, "Broader definitions capture the full range of returns but are"
  Category: Word Choice
  Issue: Claim is too strong for an analytical document
  Fix: "capture" → "may capture"

  Category: Clarity
  Issue: Awkward construction
  Fix: Flag with comment

- Location: Same section, para 1, "credentials awarded to first-generation students might have a premium compared to other students"
