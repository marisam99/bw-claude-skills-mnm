# Formatting Checklist (Phase 2)

This checklist covers document-wide formatting issues. Scan the entire document for these patterns BEFORE doing close reading.

**Recording format:** For each issue found, record immediately:
```
- Para [X]: [type] "find text" → "replacement" | reason
```
Where type is: `[replace]`, `[delete]`, `[comment_only]`, or `[insert_after]`

---

## 1. Draft Markers & Internal Notes

**Priority: HIGH** — These are easy to spot but often forgotten in final output.

Look for:
- Version stamps (e.g., "2025-11-17", "v2.3")
- Internal review notes (e.g., "FOR INTERNAL REVIEW", "FOR SUPER COPY EDITORS")
- Placeholder text: "[TK]", "[TODO]", "[INSERT X HERE]"
- Comments to self or team in running text

**Edit type:** Usually `[delete]` or `[comment_only]` to flag for author.

**Example finding:**
```
- Para 26: [delete] "| FOR SUPER COPY EDITORS – 2025-11-17" | draft marker - remove before publication
```

---

## 2. Abbreviations

On first use, spell out the term with abbreviation in parentheses. Use abbreviation alone thereafter.

**Common abbreviations to check:**
- FY (fiscal year) — "In fiscal year (FY) 2024..."
- SY (school year) — "In school year (SY) 2023-24..."
- IHEs (institutions of higher education)
- LEAs (local education agencies)
- HQIM (high-quality instructional materials)
- STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics)
- ROI (return on investment)
- ELs (English learners) — NOT "ELLs"

**Edit type:** `[replace]` to add definition, or `[comment_only]` if unsure of intended expansion.

**Example finding:**
```
- Para 95: [replace] "STEM" → "science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)" | define on first use
```

---

## 3. Sequential Elements

Verify sidebars, tables, and figures are numbered sequentially and labeled consistently.

**Check for:**
- Missing numbers: "Sidebar:" should be "Sidebar 1:" or "Sidebar 2:"
- Inconsistent labeling: "Sidebar 1" then "Sidebar:" then "Sidebar 3"
- References that don't match: "(see Table 2)" but table is labeled "Table 1"
- Vague references: "(Table)" instead of "(see Table 1)" or "the table above"

**Edit type:** `[replace]` for numbering fixes, `[comment_only]` if unclear which number is correct.

**Example finding:**
```
- Para 109: [replace] "Sidebar:" → "Sidebar 2:" | sequential numbering (follows Sidebar 1 at Para 52)
```

---

## 4. Double Spaces

Replace all double spaces with single spaces.

**Edit type:** `[replace]` — comment on first instance only.

**Example finding:**
```
- Para 47: [replace] "the  program" → "the program" | double space
- Para 89: [replace] "funding  models" → "funding models" |
```

---

## 5. Date Formatting

Remove ordinal suffixes from dates.

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| October 31st | October 31 |
| November 1st | November 1 |
| May 3rd | May 3 |

**Edit type:** `[replace]`

---

## 6. Number Formatting

- Spell out 1-9
- Use numerals for 10+
- Always use numerals for: percentages, currency, ages, addresses, measurements, course numbers

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| 5 states | five states |
| twelve evaluations | 12 evaluations |
| 2% | 2% (correct) |
| $9 billion | $9 billion (correct) |

**Edit type:** `[replace]`

---

## 7. List Item Punctuation

- Full sentences or substantial phrases → end with periods
- Single words or very short fragments → no periods needed
- Be consistent within each list

**Edit type:** `[replace]` to add/remove punctuation, or `[comment_only]` if list structure is ambiguous.

---

## 8. Hyphenation Quick Reference

| Term | Correct Form |
|------|--------------|
| nonprofit | nonprofit (one word) |
| for-profit | for-profit (hyphenated) |
| postsecondary | postsecondary (no hyphen) |
| pre-kindergarten | pre-K |
| underserved | underserved (no hyphen) |
| underrepresented | underrepresented (no hyphen) |
| socioeconomic | socioeconomic (no hyphen) |
| higher education | higher education (no hyphen) |
| dual language learners | dual language learners (no hyphen) |
| English learners | English learners (no hyphen) |
| K-12 | K-12 (hyphen OK) |
| SY25-26 | SY25-26 (hyphen OK) |

**Compound adjectives:**
- Before noun: hyphenate ("high-quality programs", "low-performing schools")
- After noun: no hyphen ("the program is high quality")
- "-ly" adverbs: never hyphenate ("highly effective teacher")

**Capacity building:**
- As noun: no hyphen ("capacity building is important")
- As adjective: hyphenate ("capacity-building services")

---

## 9. Ampersands

Spell out "and" unless "&" is part of a formal name.

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| research & development | research and development |
| Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation | Gates Foundation (as of FY25+) |
| Texas A&M | Texas A&M (correct - formal name) |

---

## 10. Contractions

**Publications:** No contractions. Spell out.
- don't → do not
- can't → cannot
- won't → will not
- it's → it is

**Client/internal docs:** Contractions acceptable.

**Edit type:** `[replace]`
