# Inclusive Language Guide (Phase 4)

This guide covers inclusive and people-first language. Deficit-based language should be **flagged for authors, not fixed** — use `[comment_only]` type.

**Recording format:**
```
- Para [X]: [comment_only] "problematic text" | FLAG: [explanation + suggested alternative]
```

---

## CRITICAL: Deficit-Based Language

**These issues require `[comment_only]` edits — flag them, do not replace them.**

Deficit-based language defines people by what they lack rather than their circumstances or systemic factors. Authors should decide how to rephrase based on context.

### Common Deficit Language Patterns

| Deficit-Based (Flag This) | Preferred Alternative | Why |
|---------------------------|----------------------|-----|
| low-income students | students from low-income households | Defines students by household circumstance, not personal deficit |
| poor students | students from low-income households | Same as above |
| foster students | students in foster care | Care status, not identity |
| homeless students | students experiencing homelessness | Temporary circumstance, not identity |
| disabled students | students with disabilities | Person-first language |
| at-risk students | students facing [specific challenge] | Vague and stigmatizing; name the actual risk |
| minority students | racially minoritized students | Emphasizes systemic marginalization, not inherent status |
| achievement gap | opportunity gap | Focuses on systemic cause, not student deficit |
| failing schools | under-resourced schools | Focuses on systemic cause |

### Example Findings

```
- Para 134: [comment_only] "low-income and adult students" | FLAG: Deficit-based language. Consider "students from low-income households and adult students" or restructure sentence.

- Para 136: [comment_only] "low-income and adult (25+) students" | FLAG: Deficit-based language. Consider "students from low-income households and adult learners (25+)".

- Para 176: [comment_only] "low-income, adult, career and technical education, and underrepresented learners" | FLAG: Deficit-based language for "low-income." Consider restructuring the list.
```

**Why flag instead of fix?**
- Context matters — the author may have a specific reason
- Restructuring may require changing more than just the phrase
- This respects author intent while raising awareness

## Capitalization Rules

### Capitalize
| Term | Example |
|------|---------|
| Black (racial identity) | "Black students" |
| Civil Rights Movement | "during the Civil Rights Movement" |
| LGBTQ+ | "LGBTQ+ students" |

### Lowercase
| Term | Example |
|------|---------|
| white (racial identity) | "white students" |
| brown (racial identity) | "brown students" |

### No Hyphen
| Term | Correct |
|------|---------|
| Asian American | Asian American (no hyphen) |
| African American | African American (no hyphen) |

## People-First vs. Identity-First Language

**Default to people-first language** unless a community has expressed preference for identity-first.

### People-First (Default)
| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| disabled students | students with disabilities |
| autistic students | students with autism* |
| blind students | students who are blind* |

*Note: Some disability communities (particularly autistic and Deaf communities) prefer identity-first language. When writing about these specific communities, research current preferences or ask.

### Identity-First (When Community Prefers)
| Community | Often Prefers |
|-----------|---------------|
| Autistic community | "autistic person" (many prefer this) |
| Deaf community | "Deaf person" (capital D = cultural identity) |

**When unsure:** Use people-first language and flag for author review.

## Avoid Ascribing Trauma

Don't label others' experiences as "traumatic" unless quoting them directly.

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| traumatic experience | disruptive experience / challenging experience |
| students traumatized by | students affected by |

**Edit type:** `[replace]` or `[comment_only]` depending on context.

---

## Citizen vs. Resident

"Citizen" has a specific legal meaning. Don't use it as a general synonym for "person" or "resident."

| Context | Correct Term |
|---------|--------------|
| Discussing legal immigration status | citizen |
| General population | resident / person / community member |
| Voting rights (in context) | citizen (if legally accurate) |

---

## Harder-to-Serve Populations

The phrase "harder-to-serve populations" appears in some policy contexts. This is acceptable when describing **institutional capacity** (the institution finds it harder to serve them), not **student deficits** (they are harder to serve because of something wrong with them).

**Context matters:**
- ✓ "institutions may neglect harder-to-serve populations" (describes institutional behavior)
- ? "harder-to-serve students" (ambiguous — consider flagging)

## Phase 4 Completion Checklist

Before proceeding, verify you have:
- [ ] Flagged ALL instances of deficit-based language (do not skip any — these are frequently lost)
- [ ] Checked capitalization (Black, white, LGBTQ+, no hyphens in Asian American/African American)
- [ ] Verified people-first language throughout
- [ ] Checked for "citizen" used incorrectly
- [ ] Flagged any trauma-ascribing language

**IMPORTANT:** Count your `[comment_only]` entries for inclusive language. These flags are the most commonly lost between analysis and JSON output. Verify each one makes it into your final edit list.

**Add all Phase 4 findings to your running list before proceeding.**
