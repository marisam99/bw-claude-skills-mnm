## Grammar

### Word Choice Fixes

| Wrong | Right | Note |
|-------|-------|------|
| comprised of | comprises / is composed of | Never use "comprised of" |
| advisor | adviser | But keep "advisory" |
| health care (adj) | health care | Two words always |
| child care (adj) | child care | Two words always |
| ed tech | ed tech | Two words |
| English language learners | English learners (ELs) | Bellwether preference |

### Between vs. Among
- **Between** = 2 items ("between the two options")
- **Among** = 3+ items ("among the five states")

### Each Other vs. One Another
- **Each other** = 2 people
- **One another** = 3+ people

### Dangerous Typos — Always Check
These typos spell-check won't catch:
- pubic → public
- shit → shift
- asses → assess

## Punctuation

### Oxford Comma
**Always use the Oxford comma.**

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| Texas, Oregon and Ohio | Texas, Oregon, and Ohio |
| vote, volunteer and serve | vote, volunteer, and serve |

### Em Dashes
**Use spaces on both sides of em dashes.**

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| funding—something difficult | funding — something difficult |
| outcomes—a term many | outcomes — a term many |

### Quotation Marks with Punctuation
- Periods and commas: **inside** closing quotes
- Colons and semicolons: **outside** closing quotes
- Question marks and exclamation points: **inside** only if part of the quoted material

| Example | Correct |
|---------|---------|
| He said "yes". | He said "yes." |
| The report defines "OBF"; however | The report defines "OBF"; however |

### Semicolons
Use to join two related independent clauses, or before transitional phrases (however, therefore, moreover) that connect independent clauses.

### Forward Slashes
- Avoid unless truly needed
- No spaces around slashes: "content/questions" not "content / questions"

### Single vs. Double Quotes
- **Double quotes** for standard quotations in running text
- **Single quotes** only for quotes within quotes

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| also known as 'OBF' | also known as "OBF" |

## Bellwether Tone

Bellwether writing is: empirical, practical, evidence-based, concise, purposeful, mission-focused, people-first, inclusive, and accessible to non-expert readers.

### Common Tone Issues to Fix

| Issue | Example | Fix | Edit Type |
|-------|---------|-----|-----------|
| Overly formal | "extant research" | "existing research" | `[replace]` |
| Jargon/cliché | "move the needle" | "improve outcomes" / "produce meaningful change" | `[replace]` |
| Unnecessary hedging | "it may perhaps be the case that" | "evidence suggests" | `[replace]` |
| Throat-clearing | "It is important to note that..." | (delete, start with the point) | `[delete]` |
| Wordy | "in order to" | "to" | `[replace]` |
| Redundancy | "past history" | "history" | `[replace]` |
| Redundancy | "research studies" | "research" or "studies" | `[replace]` |
| Redundant modifier | "for your personal reference" | "for your reference" | `[replace]` |

### Passive Voice
Convert to active where possible:

| Passive | Active |
|---------|--------|
| outcomes were improved by the program | the program improved outcomes |
| it was found that | researchers found |
| it is believed that | stakeholders believe |

**Exception:** Passive is acceptable when the actor is unknown or unimportant, or when the object is the focus.

### First Person
- **Publications:** Avoid "I", "me", "we", "our" in body text
- **Exception:** Research methods sections may use first person
- **Exception:** Acknowledgments section appropriately uses first person
- Studies cannot "interpret" or "conclude" — only authors can

## Bellwether-Specific AP Exceptions

### Organization Names
| Standard | Bellwether Style |
|----------|------------------|
| Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation | Gates Foundation (as of FY25+) |
| Teach for America | Teach For America (all caps) |
| Department of Education | U.S. Department of Education (spell out); "the Department" if context is clear; never "DOE" or "ED" |

### Fiscal Year
- First mention: "In fiscal year (FY) 2024..."
- Later mentions: "In FY24..."
- Ranges: "From FY09 to FY12..."

### School Year
- First mention: "In school year (SY) 2023-24..."
- Later mentions: "In SY23-24..."

---

## Capitalization

### Do NOT Capitalize
- theory of action
- theory of change
- state (when generic: "the state provides funding")

### Headlines/Titles
Capitalize all words except:
- Articles (a, an, the)
- Conjunctions (and, but, or)
- Prepositions 3 letters or fewer (of, to, in, for, on, at, by)

### Parentheticals
Use lowercase after opening parenthesis:
- ✓ "(for example:"
- ✗ "(For example:"

---

## Clarity & Concision

### Avoid
- "Impactful" as adjective
- Ascribing trauma ("traumatic experience" → "disruptive experience" unless quoting)
- "Citizen" when meaning "resident" or "person" (reserve for legal status)

### Flag for Author
- Repetitive sentence construction (e.g., three sentences starting with "This report...")
- Overly long/complex sentences (suggest breaking up)
- Unclear antecedents ("these models" — which models?)
- Factual inconsistencies (flag, don't fix)
