# Bellwether Color Palette Reference

## Primary Palette

These are the six core Bellwether colors. Use them for headings, accent rules,
backgrounds, and structural elements.

| Name | Hex | RGB |
|---|---|---|
| Bellwether Plum | `#6D1E4A` | 109, 30, 74 |
| Bellwether Teal | `#007786` | 0, 119, 134 |
| Deep Green | `#0D525A` | 13, 82, 90 |
| Navy | `#212B46` | 33, 43, 70 |
| Gray | `#5A6675` | 90, 102, 117 |
| Cream | `#F0DEC1` | 240, 222, 193 |

### General Color Usage Principles

- **Plum** is the lead brand color. When in doubt, default to Plum for heading
  accents, horizontal rules, and dominant design elements.
- **Teal** and **Deep Green** are supporting colors — use them for secondary
  elements, not competing with Plum.
- **Navy** works well for dark text on light backgrounds and for dark-mode or
  high-contrast design.
- **Cream** is ideal for callout box backgrounds and section dividers.
- **Gray** is for secondary text, captions, borders, and supporting UI elements.
- Never use more than 3–4 colors from the primary palette in a single document.
  Restraint is a hallmark of good Bellwether design.

## Action / Highlight Colors

Yellow and Orange are reserved for emphasis: key findings, callout boxes,
highlighted data points, and CTA elements. Do not use them as general palette
colors.

| Name | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Yellow | `#FFC762` | Primary callouts, key findings |
| Orange | `#FFB653` | Secondary callouts, data point emphasis |

## Secondary Palette

Use secondary colors to add depth, variety, and visual hierarchy. They work
well as background fills, chart series colors, and supporting accents — but
should not compete with the primary palette for dominance.

| Name | Hex |
|---|---|
| Light Gray | `#BEC6CE` |
| Deep Purple | `#2E1A4A` |
| Soft Blue | `#7EA2D1` |
| Lavender | `#CAD3FB` |
| Sky | `#9CD4EA` |
| Peach | `#FFA497` |

## Desaturated Variants

Each primary color has 75%, 50%, and 25% desaturated versions for use in
backgrounds, tints, and layered design elements.

| Core Color | Hex for 75% Variant | Hex for 50% Variant | Hex for 25% Variant |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plum | `#8A4B6E` | `#B68FA5` | `#E2D2DB` |
| Teal | `#4DA0AA` | `#80BBC3` | `#CCE4E7` |
| Deep Green | `#56868C` | `#86A9AD` | `#CFDCDE` |
| Navy | `#646B7E` | `#9095A3` | `#D3D5DA` |
| Orange (Action) | `#FFCC87` | `#FFDBA9` | `#FFF0DD` |
