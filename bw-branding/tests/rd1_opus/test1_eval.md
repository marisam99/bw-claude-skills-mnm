## Template Selection

Did Claude select the correct template for the document type?

- [X] Yes — correct template
- [ ] No — used wrong template (specify): _______________

**Notes**: Rather than just duplicating the template, Claude unpacked the entire Word template, read it to "understand" its contents, and then built the new document from scratch.

## Overall

**Did the output look like a Bellwether document?**
- [X] Yes, clearly on-brand
- [ ] Mostly, with minor issues
- [ ] No, significant brand issues

**Anything unexpected or off?** 
- I didn't expect Claude to export to PDF to visually verify the output, 
    but I liked that step. I'm not sure if we should formally integrate it or not. 
- On the first presentation of the output, the file was unreadable (Word 
    flagged unreadable content that was irreparable). Upon prompting, Claude 
    was able to fix it, saying, "The original template file was a .dotx (Word 
    template), and the internal content type was still declaring it as a template 
    rather than a document — which caused Word to reject it when opened as a .docx."
- Claude did not put spaces between paragraphs in the memo. This is not a big issue,
    but it is something I would expect in something like this for readability.
