## Typography

| Check | Result (Pass, Fail, N/A) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Garamond used for document/slide title | Pass | N/A |
| Avenir Next LT Pro used for headings (H1–H3) | N/A | N/A |
| Avenir Next LT Pro used for body text | Fail | It used Aptos, though, which tells me that the fallback instructions worked, but Avenir Next LT Pro is loaded in PPT, so I'm not sure why it had to use Aptos |
| No unexpected fonts introduced | Pass | N/A |

---

## Colors

| Check | Result (Pass, Fail, N/A) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Plum used as primary accent | Pass | N/A |
| No off-brand colors introduced | Pass | N/A |
| Action colors (Yellow/Orange) used only for emphasis | Pass | Given the finding it inferred -- "4th grade math proficiency varies widely across districts" -- it correctly did not use an action color because there was no one data point to highlight. |

## Data Visualization (skip if no charts/tables)

| Check | Result (Pass, Fail, N/A) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Correct chart type selected for the data | Pass | Somewhat easy given that the prompt has the chart type |
| Color sequence follows brand order (Plum → Teal → ...) | N/A | Only used plum |
| Chart title states the finding (not just a description) | Fail | This is an ok fail since the slide title has the finding |
| No 3D effects, unnecessary gridlines, or legends | Pass | N/A |
