## Test Info

**Eval #**: Powerpoint Deck

## Template Selection

Did Claude select the correct template for the document type?

- [X] Yes — correct template
- [ ] No — used wrong template (specify): _______________
- [ ] Not applicable (e.g. spreadsheet or chart only)

**Notes**: Similar to the first test, Claude unpacked and "analyzed" the PPT template rather than just duplicating and editing it. I did see value in this however, since Claude only pulled the template slides that it wanted to use rather than trying to sort through all of them.

## Clarifying Questions

Did Claude ask appropriate clarifying questions before proceeding?

- [ ] Asked the right question(s) — specify: _______________
- [ ] Asked unnecessary or confusing questions — specify: _______________
- [X] Should have asked but didn't — specify: Could have asked whether this was an in-person presentation (less text), versus a virtual/pre-read deck (more text). However, since I specified using placeholders, this worked fine for now. In a real query, I would have had more context and information to give.
- [ ] No questions needed for this task

## Overall

**Did the output look like a Bellwether document?**
- [X] Yes, clearly on-brand
- [ ] Mostly, with minor issues
